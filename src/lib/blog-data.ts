    title: 'üß† The "All & Only" Idea for Prompt Contexts',
    description: 'In the world of AI prompting, context is everything. The better the prompt context, the more intelligent and relevant the response. But what exactly should be in that context? Enter the "All & Only" idea‚Äîa simple yet powerful mental model to refine prompt design.',

    content: `What is "All & Only"?\nAll: Include all the necessary information the AI needs to give a complete answer.\n\nOnly: Include only the information that is relevant to the task.\n\nThink of it as optimizing for clarity without clutter.\n\nWhy It Matters\nMost prompt failures happen because the input is either too vague or too bloated. Providing incomplete data leads to hallucination or gaps in logic, while providing irrelevant context introduces noise that derails the output.\n\nLet's say you're building a prompt for generating summaries of legal documents. Using the "All & Only" principle:\n\n‚úÖ All: Case type, key legal points, ruling.\n\n‚ùå Only: Don't include unrelated law firm bios or document formatting metadata.\n\nReal-world Example\nImagine you're building an AI assistant for a support team:\n\nBad prompt: "Here's everything about the user, server logs, chat history, and backend configs. What's the issue?"\n\nGood prompt: "User reported issue X at time Y. Chat logs show error Z. Backend logs confirm 500 error. Diagnose."\n\nThe second version follows the "All & Only" principle‚Äîgiving all that matters and nothing more.\n\nTips to Apply "All & Only"\nPreprocess data: Extract key info beforehand.\n\nChunk and tag: Use sections with headers if your prompt needs structure.\n\nUse instructions: Clearly direct the model to focus on specific areas.\n\nIn short, the "All & Only" idea helps you craft lean, purpose-driven prompts that deliver sharp results.`,

A good README file is more than a formality. It's the first handshake between your project and its potential users, contributors, or even investors.",
